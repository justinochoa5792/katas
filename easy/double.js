// Use map() to double the values in an array
// Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help.

function double(array) {
  // Use array.map() to return a new array with each value twice
  // as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array.
  return array.map((el) => el * 2);
}
