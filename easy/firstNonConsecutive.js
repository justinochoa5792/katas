// Find the first non-consecutive number
// Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
// If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.
// The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

function firstNonConsecutive(arr) {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] !== 1) return arr[i];
  }
  return null;
}
