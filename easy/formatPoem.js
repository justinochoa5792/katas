// Thinkful - String Drills: Poem formatter
// Write a function that takes a string (like the one line example) as an argument, returns a new string that is formatted across multiple lines, with each new sentence starting on a new line when you print it out.
// Try to solve this challenge with the str.split() and the str.join() string methods.
// Every sentence will end with a period, and every new sentence will have one space before the previous period. Be careful about trailing whitespace in your solution.

function formatPoem(poem) {
  //your code here
  return poem
    .split(". ")
    .map((s) => (s.endsWith(".") ? s : s.concat(".")))
    .join("\n");
}
