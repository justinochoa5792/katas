// Training JS #18: Methods of String object--concat() split() and its good friend join()
// The expected algorithm: split the string into words by spaces, split each word into separate characters and join them back with the specified separator, join all the resulting "words" back into a sentence with spaces.

function splitAndMerge(string, separator) {
  return string
    .split(" ")
    .map((el) => el.split("").join(separator))
    .join(" ");
}
