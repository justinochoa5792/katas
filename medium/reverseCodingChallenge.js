// Reverse Coding Challenge #3
// This is a reverse coding challenge. Normally you're given explicit directions with how to create a function. Here, you must generate your own function to satisfy the relationship between the inputs and outputs.
// Your task is to create a function that, when fed the inputs below, produces the sample outputs shown.

function mysteryFunc(arr, num) {
  return arr.map((x) => x % num);
}
